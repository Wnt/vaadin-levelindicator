/**
 * 
 * <p>
 * This filter primitive lights a source graphic using the alpha channel as a bump map. The resulting image is an RGBA image based on the light color. The lighting calculation
 * follows the standard specular component of the Phong lighting model. The resulting image depends on the light color, light position and surface geometry of the input bump map.
 * The result of the lighting calculation is added. The filter primitive assumes that the viewer is at infinity in the z direction (i.e., the unit vector in the eye direction is
 * (0,0,1) everywhere).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This filter primitive produces an image which contains the specular reflection part of the lighting calculation. Such a map is intended to be combined with a texture using the
 * add term of the arithmetic ‘feComposite’ method. Multiple light sources can be simulated by adding several of these light maps before applying it to the texture image.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The resulting RGBA image is computed as follows:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p class="filterformula">
 * S<sub>r</sub> = k<sub>s</sub> * pow(N.H, specularExponent) * L<sub>r<br>
 * </sub> S<sub>g</sub> = k<sub>s</sub> * pow(N.H, specularExponent) * L<sub>g<br>
 * </sub> S<sub>b</sub> = k<sub>s</sub> * pow(N.H, specularExponent) * L<sub>b<br>
 * </sub> S<sub>a</sub> = max(S<sub>r,</sub> S<sub>g,</sub> S<sub>b</sub>)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Where
 * </p>
 * 
 * <dd>k<sub>s</sub> = specular lighting constant<br>
 * N = surface normal unit vector, a function of x and y<br>
 * H = "halfway" unit vector between eye unit vector and light unit vector<br>
 * <br>
 * L<sub>r</sub>,L<sub>g</sub>,L<sub>b</sub> = RGB components of light</dd>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike the ‘feDiffuseLighting’, the ‘feSpecularLighting’ filter produces a non-opaque image. This is due to the fact that the specular result (Sr,Sg,Sb,Sa) is meant to be added
 * to the textured image. The alpha channel of the result is the max of the color components, so that where the specular light is zero, no additional coverage is added to the image
 * and a fully white highlight will add opacity.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The ‘feDiffuseLighting’ and ‘feSpecularLighting’ filters will often be applied together. An implementation may detect this and calculate both maps in one pass, instead of two.
 * </p>
